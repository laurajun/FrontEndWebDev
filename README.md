# Foundations of Front-End Web Development with Davide Molins course https://www.udemy.com/share/101ryMAEMacF5XRHoJ/

# Why do I do this? 

  I want to get back in Web development. 
  Towards full stack. 
  Partly this is familiar material but 
  I need a little refreshment.

# homepage

I builded simple basic website template using Udemy course Foundations of Front-End Web Development.
I really got into this subject again and I will continue learning :)

# jQuery

I got into jQuery features, gosh, I love it. Less rows, more performance and clarity.
I didn't know earlier that calls can be chained although good documentation is gold with this feature I think.

# backbone.js

This is bit of old for nowadays but good ABC for me before I move to react.js. I can't wait it. 
With backbone.js I can test few onepage applications. 

# Foogle play workshop

Good practise to build onepage application imitating Google Play Books this time. 
Tomorrow I get into making this page dynamic with backbone.js.

Everything started good but I got troubles with json data, because all my browsers kept warning about CORS policy and the key functions couldn't be executed. All the code is correct and I keep moving on with this but need to figure out what is the most secure way to test...
