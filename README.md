# FrontEndWebDev

# Why I do this? 

  I want to get back in Web development. 
  Towards full stack. 
  Partly this is familiar material but 
  I need little refreshment.

# Front End Web Development exercises part 1 = homepage

I builded simple basic website template using Udemy course Foundations of Front-End Web Development.
I really got into this subject again and I will continue learning :)

# Front End Web Development exercises part 2 = jQuery

I got into jQuerys features, gosh, I love it. Less rows, more performance and clarity.
I didn't know earlier that calls can be chained.
