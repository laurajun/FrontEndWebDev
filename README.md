# FrontEndWebDev

# Why I do this? 

  I want to get back in Web development. 
  Towards full stack. 
  Partly this is familiar material but 
  I need little refreshment.

# homepage

I builded simple basic website template using Udemy course Foundations of Front-End Web Development.
I really got into this subject again and I will continue learning :)

# jQuery

I got into jQuery features, gosh, I love it. Less rows, more performance and clarity.
I didn't know earlier that calls can be chained.

# backbone.js

This is bit of old for nowadays but good ABC for me before I move to react.js. 
With backbone.js I can test onepage applications.
